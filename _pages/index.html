<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>To our little home away from home.
<p>Here, have some (terribly old) <a href="screenshots">screenshots</a>. Or take an (even older) <a href="tour">tour</a>. For good measure, you can find some up to date but utterly unorganized pictures <a href="https://www.brage.info/e9/">here</a>.
<p>In case you're new here, Erisia is running a 1.7.10 TPPI2-based modpack. If you look at the tab list above, you'll find setup instructions as well as maps of Erisia.
<p>This is largely a place for building your own infrastructure. Cooperation is encouraged, but not required; we understand that building your own bases is fun. The reason you should do so here, and not in single-player, is because visiting other people and discussing your builds is also fun, and sometimes so is collaboration. The reason you should do so here, and not on a different server, is for the people you can find here, but also because our admins will make a desperate effort to recover from bugs and also frequent backups.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Griefing and nonconsensual PvP are both forbidden. If in doubt, don't do it.
	<li>Quarries and quarry-like autominers are all forbidden in the
	  Overworld and Twilight Forest, largely due to being crash-prone,
	  but also lag. Digital Miners and RotaryCraft borers are exempt
	  from this.<br>  They are explicitly <em>not</em> forbidden in the
	  Deep Dark and Bedrock dimensions. If unsure, ask.
	<li>Buildcraft quarries are forbidden in the Nether for lag reasons. I recommend using RotaryCraft borers instead.
	<li>Exploits are... inadvisable. If you are found to be using one, you may find that the results go poof, destroying hours of work.
	<li>At least <em>try</em> to make things look nice. There's
	  no requirement, but it'd improve your reputation.
	<li>That said, have fun!
</ul>
Now, some limits on use of admin powers...
<ul>
	<li>Admin powers shall not be used except to fix obvious bugs or game-destroying situations.
	<li>If the game-destroying situation is "I got stuck in
	  Mystcraft" or "I ended up forty thousand kilometers out and
	  can't get back", then there's a mandatory half-hour timeout
	  prior to action and you don't get to keep your inventory.
	<li>Unless the audience unanimously thinks otherwise.
	<li>These rules are subject to change via supermajority
	  vote, with Baughn getting veto rights.
</ul>
